	abstract = {In recent years, cloud edge collaborative computing has been widely used in the information technology field but is still unfamiliar in manufacturing because of industrial communication limitations and workers' lack of corresponding knowledge. Nowadays, 5G can realize real-time communication between cloud and edge with its Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communication (uRLLC) and Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) function, and UMATI (Universal Machine Technology Interface) can be used to connect the machine with heterogeneous data. These technologies break the communication bottleneck but are still unfamiliar in manufacturing. In this paper, a concept of 5G-based cloud learning factory is proposed to promote practical capability so that learners can better comprehend cloud service technology and implement it into manufacturing. The training process design and the current progress of study case implementation in Advanced Manufacturing Technology Center (AMTC) at Tongji University (Shanghai, China) are introduced in detail. Finally, two study cases are implemented to give learners an environment to practice with a 5G plug-and-play module and MEC server deployed in the edge and cloud.},
